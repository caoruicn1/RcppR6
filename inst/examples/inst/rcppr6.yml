# Writing this, it's apparent that extra levels of indenting are going
# to be likely and very difficult to troubleshoot.  Probably going to
# need some validation tools here.  That's not that horrible to do,
# and we can just dump that validation code into the part that reads
# things, or run it separately.
#
# But stress test with things like adding extra '-' in front of (say)
# methods, or method names.
