# Requirements

We depend on [cog](http://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/).  This can be installed fairly easily following the instructions on the cog webpage.  Eventually I may port cog to R (but probably continue to use Python for the heavy lifting).  That could involve using rPython, but that package does not work on Windows.
